# atom-theme-pulamusic-ui

This is my theme to fiddle with. If I get to like it I can submit a UI theme back to the official project.

**10/25/2020 | 09:52 EDT (GMT-04:00) | I started my own theme, titled `atom-theme-pulamusic/`.**

Here is some text from the [Atom Flight Manual pages that describe setting up to create a UI theme](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/creating-a-theme/#creating-a-ui-theme).

#### Creating a UI Theme

To create a UI theme, do the following:

* Fork the `ui-theme-template`
* Clone the forked repository to the local filesystem
* Open a terminal in the forked theme's directory
* Open your new theme in a Dev Mode Atom window run `atom --dev .` in the terminal or use the *View > Developer > Open in Dev Mode* menu
* Change the name of the theme in the theme's `package.json` file
* Name your theme end with a `-ui`, for example `super-white-ui`
* Run `apm link --dev` to symlink your repository to `~/.atom/dev/packages`
* Reload Atom using `Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+L`
* Enable the theme via the "UI Theme" drop-down in the "Themes" tab of the Settings View
* Make changes! Since you opened the theme in a Dev Mode window, changes will be instantly reflected in the editor without having to reload.

> **Tip**: Because we used `apm link --dev` in the above instructions, if you break anything you can always close Atom and launch Atom normally to force Atom to the default theme. This allows you to continue working on your theme even if something goes catastrophically wrong.

# Atom UI Theme Template

This is a __starter template__ for creating an Atom UI theme.

This template only includes the __minimum of styling__ needed and comes with a neutral look. It could already be used as a real theme, but its purpose is to serve as a basis for creating your own theme. It is documented throughout and invites you to make changes to your liking. For some inspiration take a look at other Atom themes at [atom.io/themes](https://atom.io/themes/). Or you're always free to fork a theme that already comes close to your vision.

Happy theming! ðŸš€


## Getting started

1. Fork this repository.

2. Continue with step 2 from [Creating a UI Theme](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/creating-a-theme/#creating-a-ui-theme)

3. If you get stuck somewhere, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/atom-community/ui-theme-template/issues/new).

**ps**. Don't forget to delete the above and edit the below in your own `README.md`.
