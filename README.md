# atom-theme-pulamusic-ui

This is my theme to fiddle with. If I get to like it I can submit a UI theme back to the official project.

*10/25/2020 | 09:52 EDT (GMT-04:00) | I started my own theme, titled `atom-theme-pulamusic-ui/`*

#### **VERY IMPORTANT**

Always work on this project in dev mode: `atom --dev .`

Always work on a branch other than `master`.

* 10/25/2020 | 11:05 EDT (GMT-04:00) currently working on `color-palette` branch

#### to-do [^1]

- [X] rough out a color palette
- [ ] adjust margins and padding
- [ ] decide on packages for theme
- [X] documentation
- [ ] add testing: [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html)

#### questions

Does a ui theme come with a pre-determined set of packages?

* If not, I can add a list of suggested Atom packages.
* How many packages are there? Is there some way to search the collections of plugins by category?

Is it cool to add CSS behaviors to the ui, or is that against some sort of coding aesthetic?

Can I add scripts?

# Atom UI Theme Template

This is a __starter template__ for creating an Atom UI theme.

This template only includes the __minimum of styling__ needed and comes with a neutral look. It could already be used as a real theme, but its purpose is to serve as a basis for creating your own theme. It is documented throughout and invites you to make changes to your liking. For some inspiration take a look at other Atom themes at [atom.io/themes](https://atom.io/themes/). Or you're always free to fork a theme that already comes close to your vision.

Happy theming! ðŸš€


## Getting started

~~1. Fork this repository.~~

2. Continue with step 2 from [Creating a UI Theme](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/creating-a-theme/#creating-a-ui-theme)

If you get stuck somewhere, feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/atom-community/ui-theme-template/issues/new).

ps. Don't forget to delete the above and edit the below in your own `README.md`.
